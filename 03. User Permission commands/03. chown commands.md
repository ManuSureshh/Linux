## The $chown (change owner) commands are used to  modify the owner of files and directories.

- To Change the owner of a file: -
  ```
  chown owner filename
  ```
  Example: -
  ```
  chown manvith demo.txt
  ```

- To Change the owner and group of a file: -
  ```
  chown owner:group filename
  ```
  Example: -

  ```
  chown manvith:devops demo.txt
  ```

- To Change the owner of a directory and its contents recursively: -
  ```
  chown -R owner directory
  ```
  Example: -
  ```
  chown -R manvith /home/ubuntu
  ```

- To Change the owner and group of a directory and its contents recursively: -
  ```
  chown -R owner:group directory
  ```
  Example: -
  ```
  chown -R manvith:devops /home/ubuntu
  ```

- To Change the owner but not follow symbolic links (affects symbolic links themselves): -
  ```
  chown -h owner filename
  ```

  Example: -
  ```
  chown -h manvith demo.txt
  ```

- To Change ownership only if current owner and group match: -
  ```
  chown --from=current_owner:current_group new_owner:new_group filename
  ```
  Example: -
  ```
  chown --from=oldowner:oldgroup manvith:devops demo.txt
  ```

- Suppress most error messages:
  ```
  chown --silent owner filename
  ```
  ```
  chown -f owner filename
  ```
  Example: -
  ```
  chown --silent manvith filename
  ```
  ```
  chown -f manvith filename
  ```

- To Display diagnostic information for every file processed:
  ```
  chown --verbose owner filename
  ```
  ```
  chown -v owner filename
  ```

  Example: -
  ```
  chown -v manvith demo.txt
  ```

- To Change only the group of a file
  ```
  chown :group filename
  ```
  ```
  chgrp group filename
  ```
  Example: -
  ```
  chown :devops demo.txt
  ```

  
- Set ownership based on a reference file:
  ```
  chown --reference=ref_file filename
  ```

  Example: -
  ```
  chown --reference=ref_file demo.txt
  ```

- Change ownership of files pointed to by symbolic links (default behavior):
  ```
  chown -L owner filename
  ```
  Example: -
  ```
  chown -L manvith demo.txt
  ```

- Do not traverse symbolic links while operating recursively (useful with -R): -
  ```
  chown -P owner directory
  ```
  Example: -
  ```
  chown -P manvith /home/ubuntu
  ```

- Traverse each symbolic link encountered that points to a directory:
  ```
  chown -H owner directory
  ```

  Example: -

  ```
  chown -H manvith /home/ubuntu
  ```

- Combine options for specific needs:
  ```
  chown -Rv owner:group directory
  ```
  Examples: -

  ```
  chown -Rv manvith:devops /home/ubuntu
  ```
