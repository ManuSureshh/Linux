The **``chgrp``** command in Linux is used to change the group ownership of files and directories. In Unix-like operating systems, every file and directory has an owner and a group associated with it. The chgrp command allows users to modify which group is associated with a file or directory.

- Change group ownership of a file:
  ```
  chgrp groupname filename
  ```

- Change group ownership of a directory:
  ````
  chgrp groupname directoryname
  ````

- Change group ownership recursively:
  ```
  chgrp -R groupname directoryname
  ```

- Change group ownership using a numeric group ID:
  ```
  chgrp 1001 filename
  ```

- Verbose mode:
  ```
  chgrp -v groupname filename
  ```

- Change group ownership of multiple files:
  ```
  chgrp groupname file1 file2 file3
  ```

- Change group ownership using a symbolic link (to change the group of the linked file):
  ```
  chgrp -h groupname symlink
  ```
