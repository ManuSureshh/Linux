- Permissions are represented by a three-digit octal number:
  - Read (r) = 4
  - write (w) = 2
  - Execute (x) = 1

**01. Grant read, write, and execute to the owner; read and execute to the group and others.**   
      
  ```
      chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx filename
  ```
  [or]

  ```
      chmod 755 filename
  ```

**02. Grant read and write to the owner; read only to the group and others.**
      
  ```
      chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r filename
  ```

  [or]

  ```
      chmod 644 filename
  ```

**03. Grant read and write to the owner and group; no permissions to others**
  ```
      chmod u=rw,g=rw,o= filename
  ```
  [or]

  ```
      chmod 660 filename
  ```

**04. Grant full permissions to the owner, and execute only to the group and others**
  ```
       chmod u=rwx,g=x,o=x filename
  ```
  [or]

  ``` 
       chmod 711 filename
  ```

**05. Remove all permissions from the group and others**
  ```
      chmod g=,o= filename
  ```
  [or]

  ```
      chmod 700 filename
  ```

**06. Set the setuid bit (execute file as the owner)**

  ```
      chmod u+s filename
  ```
  [or]

  ```
      chmod 4755 filename
  ```

**07. Set the setgid bit (execute file as the group)**
  ```
      chmod g+s filename
  ```
  [or]
  ```
      chmod 2755 filename
  ```

**08. Set the sticky bit (only the owner can delete files in the directory)**
  ```
     chmod +t directoryname
  ```
  [or]
  ```
     chmod 1755 directoryname
  ```

**09. Recursively change permissions for a directory and all its contents, grant read, write, and execute to the owner; read and execute to the group and others**
  ```
     chmod -R u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx directoryname
  ```
[or]

```
   chmod -R 755 directoryname
```
