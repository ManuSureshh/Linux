#### The ```sort``` command in Linux is used to arrange the lines of text in files or standard input in a specified order.
- To sort the content in an alphabetical order
  ```
  sort file.txt
  ```
  
-  To sort the multiple files
   ```
   sort file1.txt file2.txt
   ```
   
-  To get the sort in reverse order
   ```
   sort -r file.txt
   ```
   
-  For case sensitive sorting
   ```
   sort -f file.txt
   ```

-  For numerical order sorting
   ```
   sort -n file.txt
   ```
