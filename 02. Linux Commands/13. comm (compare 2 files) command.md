- The `comm` command is basically used to compare two files or streams.
- By default it displays 3 columns. The first displays non-mathcing columns of the first file, second for the second file and thrid for the third file.

**Comparing 2 Files**
- Suppose you have two sorted files, file1.txt and file2.txt, and you want to see their differences and commonalities:
  ```
  comm file1.txt file2.txt
  ```
  - This will produce three columns:
    - Lines only in file1.txt
    - Lines only in file2.txt
    - Lines common to both files
**Suppressing Unique Lines:**
- To display only the lines that are common to both files:
  ```
  comm -12 file1.txt file2.txt
  ```
  - -1 suppresses lines unique to file1.txt
  - -2 suppresses lines unique to file2.txt

**Suppressing Common Lines:**
- To display only the lines that are unique to each file:
  ```
  comm -3 file1.txt file2.txt
  ```
  - -3 suppresses lines that are common to both files

Notes
-
- Both files must be sorted for comm to work correctly. If they are not, you can sort them using the sort command before using comm.
- The comm command can be used to help in various text-processing tasks where comparing files is necessary, such as in data analysis or configuration management.
