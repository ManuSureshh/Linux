The `sed` command is a stream editor used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).


**Basic Syntax**
```
sed [OPTION]... {SCRIPT} [FILE]...
```
Examples: -
- Substitute a string in a file:
  ```
  sed 's/old/new/' filename
  ```
  - This replaces the first occurrence of old with new in each line.
- Substitute globally:
  ```
  sed 's/old/new/g' filename
  ```
  - This replaces all occurrences of old with new in each line.
- Delete lines matching a pattern:
  ```
  sed '/pattern/d' filename
  ```
Notes
-
sed reads the file line by line, applies the script to each line, and outputs the result.
For more complex scripts, you can use sed in combination with other commands or write multi-line scripts.
