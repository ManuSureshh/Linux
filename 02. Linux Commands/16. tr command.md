The `tr` command is used to translate or delete characters from the input.
**Basic Syntax**
```
tr [OPTION] SET1 [SET2]
```
**Examples**
- Translate characters:
  ```
  echo "hello" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
  ```
  - This translates all lowercase letters to uppercase.
- Delete characters:
  ```
  echo "hello 123" | tr -d '0-9'
  ```
  - This deletes all digits from the input.
- Replace characters:
  ```
  echo "hello world" | tr ' ' '\n'
  ```
  - This replaces spaces with newlines.

Notes: -
-
- `tr` operates on characters, not strings or lines.
- Use `tr` for simple character transformations rather than complex text processing.
