The `uniq` command filters out repeated lines in a file or input.
**Basic Syntax**
```
uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
```
**Examples**
- Remove duplicate lines:
  ```
  uniq filename
  ```
  - This removes adjacent duplicate lines from filename.
- Count occurrences of lines:
  ```
  uniq -c filename
  ```
  - This prefixes lines with the number of occurrences.
- Display only duplicate lines:
  ```
  uniq -d filename
  ```
  - This shows only lines that are repeated.

Notes: -
-
- `uniq` only removes adjacent duplicate lines. To ensure proper functionality, sort the file before using uniq.
- Use `sort` in combination with uniq for broader duplicate detection.
