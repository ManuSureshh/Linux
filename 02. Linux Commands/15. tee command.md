The `tee` command reads from standard input and writes to standard output and files simultaneously.

**Basic Syntax**
```
tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

**Examples**
- Write output to a file and display it:
  ```
  echo "Hello World" | tee file.txt
  ```
  - This writes "Hello World" to file.txt and displays it on the terminal.
- Append output to a file:
  ```
  echo "Another line" | tee -a file.txt
  ```
  - The -a option appends the output to file.txt rather than overwriting it.

Notes: -
-
- `tee` is useful for logging output while also processing it further in a pipeline.
- You can use tee with multiple files by specifying multiple file names.
