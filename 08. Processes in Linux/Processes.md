## Processes in Linux: -
- In Linux, a process is a running instance of a program.
- Processes are fundamental to the operation of a Linux system, enabling multitasking and the execution of multiple programs simultaneously.

### Types of Processes in Linux
1. Foreground Processes: -
   - These are processes that run directly from the terminal and occupy it until they finish execution.
   - The user can interact with these processes directly.
     
2. Background Processes:
   - These run in the background and do not occupy the terminal.
   - They are initiated by appending an & at the end of the command.
   
4. Daemon Processes:
   - These are special background processes that start during boot and run continuously, usually providing services (like web servers, print servers).
