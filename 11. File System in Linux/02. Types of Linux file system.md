# File Systems and Swap Space Overview

This document provides an overview of various file systems and swap space used in computing. The table below includes descriptions, key features, and limitations of each system.

## File Systems

| File System      | Description                                                                                 | Key Features                                    | Limitations                                      |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **EXT**          | The original Extended File System, precursor to later versions like EXT2, EXT3, and EXT4.  | Basic file system features.                     | Limited functionality compared to later versions.|
| **EXT2**         | The second version of the Extended File System.                                                | Supports up to 2TB of data.                     | No journaling, potential data loss on crash.     |
| **EXT3**         | An extension of EXT2 with added journaling capabilities.                                             | Journaling, improved data integrity.            | Limited scalability compared to EXT4.           |
| **EXT4**         | The fourth iteration with enhanced performance and features.                                    | Journaling, supports up to 1 exabyte, extents.  | None significant compared to EXT3.              |
| **JFS**          | Journaled File System developed by IBM for AIX Unix.                                        | Efficient with limited CPU power.               | Less commonly used on Linux now.                |
| **ReiserFS**     | An alternative to EXT3, known for handling small files efficiently.                            | Used as a default file system in some Linux distributions. Dynamically supports file extensions. | Performance issues, less common now.            |
| **XFS**          | High-performance file system developed by Silicon Graphics, now used in Linux. Developed for parallel I/O processing. Used by NASA.             | Excellent scalability, journaling, large file support. | Complexity and higher overhead for small files. |
| **Btrfs**        | B-tree file system designed to address shortcomings of other file systems. Supports fault tolerance, repair, and more.                 | Advanced features like snapshots, checksums, and dynamic inode allocation. | Still maturing, can have stability issues.      |
| **Swap**         | Swap space used for memory paging in Linux OS. Essential for systems with limited RAM. A system that never hibernates still benefits from appropriate swap space for managing memory. | Extends physical memory, essential for virtual memory management. | Can affect performance if not properly sized.   |
