# Linux File System Features

## Hierarchical Structure
- The Linux file system follows a tree-like structure with the root directory (`/`) at the top.
- All other directories and files are organized within this hierarchy.

## Root Directory (`/`)
- The top-level directory from which all other directories and files stem.
- It unifies all physical hard drives and partitions into a single directory structure.

## Common Directories
- `/bin`: Contains essential system binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`).
- `/boot`: Holds boot loader files (kernel, initial RAM disk, configuration).
- `/dev`: Contains device files representing hardware devices.
- `/etc`: Stores system and application configuration files.
- `/home`: Contains user home directories.
- `/lib`: Holds essential shared libraries.
- `/media`: Used for mounting removable media (USB drives, CDs, DVDs).
- `/mnt`: Used as a mount point for other file systems.

## Case Sensitivity and Hidden Files
- Linux file systems are always case-sensitive.
- Hidden files start with a dot (`.`) as their prefix (e.g., `.hidden_file`).
