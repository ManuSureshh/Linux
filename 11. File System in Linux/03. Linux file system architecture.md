## Linux file system architecture: -
**It has a hierarchical file structure**
- Linux organizes files and directories in a tree-like structure.
- The root directory (“/”) serves as the starting point, with subdirectories branching out from it.
- Each directory can contain files and additional subdirectories.

**Can manage and provide for non-volatile storage data**
- Linux manages storage devices (such as hard drives, SSDs, and USB drives) to store data persistently.
- File systems like ext4, XFS, and Btrfs are commonly used to organize and manage data on these storage devices.

**Namespace describes logical structure of file**
- The namespace defines the logical structure of files and directories.
- Each file or directory has a unique path (e.g., /home/user/documents/file.txt).
- The hierarchical arrangement allows efficient navigation and acces

**Stores advanced information about partitions**
- Linux stores detailed information about partitions, including their size, type, and mount points.
- Tools like `fdisk`, `parted`, and `lsblk` provide insights into partition layout.
